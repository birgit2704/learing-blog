    <h4>How I got started</h4> 
    <p>It all started in June of 2022. My son came home from school all excited. "Mom, there's a memory trainer at our school today, we did some fun things and tonight he gives a presentation, I want to go!" So we went and the trainer inspired me, too.</p>
    <p> While my friends were starting to complain about getting older and the occasional memory lapse, I could see that EVERYTHING was possible. So I thought to myself: Now, that I know that I can easily learn anything I want, what would excite me the most? The answer was right there: Coding. I have always wanted to learn to code, but then - life happened and I postponed and then I simply forgot...</p>
    <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4> 
    <p>I love coding, so it doesn't take much to stay committed. But of course I have those moments when everything seems too much, when I am frustrated or burnt out. Then I go back to the many projects that I have built up to now. Mostly, I think: Wow, I have built this? In just 12 months I have learned to create things like that? Magnificent! I also look at peers' projects and think: I could code that, too! Most of the time, this is enough to get me going again.</p>

    longText: ` <p>My husband still thinks that with all the time I spend coding, I will turn into some nerdy hacker. Like the ones on TV who hack into systems, plant bugs, and sneak into server rooms to destroy - or save - the world.</p> <p>His view on computers and software is that both make life a lot more complicated and therefore have to be avoided at all cost. This is due to the insufficient training he -as physician and surgeon - has received in the hospitals he has been working. Generally, for him IT means filling out online forms, endlessly searching for files and calling Help-desk.</p>
    <p>The other day, my son came into my "office". I proudly presented him the restaurant order app I was coding. He asked: "Mom, how much do they pay you when you have finished the app?" I answered, that I was still learning and, that I was me who was paying for the course to code. He just sighed, turned away and left.ü§ë</p>
    <p>I am waiting for the day when I sign an employment contract, then I'll invite both of them to something really fancy with the money I GET and I'll clarify that I will NEVER be able to hack the Pentagon.</p>

    longText: `<p>A little time ago, the telephone rang. It was a friend of a friend offering me a job üòÄ- as office clerk for the local flower shop üò≠.</p>
    <p>I said, no thanks and that I was studying because I wanted to become a software developer. After I had hung up, I was very upset. Why did I say I WANTED to become a software developer? I was finishing my 9-module course and the only thing left for me to do was to finish the capstone project to get the certificate. What I should have said: "no thanks to your job offer, I AM a software developer and we should talk about your web page, I have seen it can be improved. I have some ideas. When can we meet?" Why am I not confident like this?</p>
    <p>So I decided to get more confidence. I eat an apple every day (not to keep the doctor away, ha-ha) and with every bite I say to myself: "I am a software developer" Do you know what? This simple and - admittedly stupid - routine has changed the way I think of myself. I AM a software developer now. - Just not yet with a job.</p>`,

    longText: `<p>I love to read. Mostly books of self-improvement and one phrase that stuck was "Failing to plan is planning to fail"üìñ.</p> <p>So I wrote down a plan for the whole week, structuring each day. What I would learn, planning when I'll be finished with this module and then be able to start the next one, and on the weekends, I could do the Typescript course on the side and then next weekend, I would do a Git and GitHub refresher and with all that I'll finish the specialization in two months. But before I start to apply for a job, I'd need to at least take a look at SASS and Tailwind, which I could fit in if I expanded my studying time just by 15 minutes each day from now on.</p>
    <p>The next day, I enthusiastically worked off all the points on my plan and congratulated myself to this great decision to structure my time like that.üëç</p>
    <p>The day after I struggled through the points.</p>
    <p>On the third day, I didn't quite get there and had to re-organize everything.</p>
    <p>The day after that I didn't feel like coding and started to clean my workplace. More thoroughly than ever.üßπ</p>
    <p>The next day I started the day with a good cry ü•πconvinced that I would never reach any goal at all.</p>
    <p>I spent many weeks like that. Enthusiastic on Mondays and completely destroyed by Thursday at the latest.</p>
    <p>I turned to myself for help and came up with an idea. Do you want to know what did the trick for me? I didn't need to give up planning ahead, I just changed from "today I have to finish module 4" to "today I'll learn for two hours".</p> <p>I didn't feel the pressure any longer of having to reach a goal. Simply to do my best for the planned time was enough. This brought back the joy into my coding journey.</p>
    <p>And Sunday's are off. It is difficult to keep away from the keyboard for a whole day, but I do have a life, after all.üèñÔ∏è</p>

    shortText: `The difference between feedback and <i>feedback</i>`,
    longText: `<p>I was doing a course where fellow students had to evaluate each other's projects. One project was a site for a jewellery shop. I outdid myself and incorporated a lot of really amazing hovering and other effects, because I loved what did and - why not admit it - to show off what I could accomplish. I was sure, the others would be flashed.üíé</p>
    <p>Two of feedbacks I received were "nice job" - not exactly the praise I had hoped for, but still... The third evaluator wrote that my site did not have a modern look. NOT MODERN!!! I felt like punching him in his nose.üëä Judging from his username this guy lived on the other side of the globe. His luck!</p>
    <p>A few days later I had another look at my project and seeing it with fresh eyes, I had to admit that he indeed was right. The playfulness of the effects did not convey the sharp, matter-of-fact and straight-forward interface that modern sites have. In all of my follow-up projects I have had this in the back of my mind and I think all projects have turned out better for this.‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <p>One day at work, I was commenting to my collegues about a problem I had with my husband. They were all on my side and said how right I was. Of course they were, because they liked me. All but one. One collegue caught me alone at the coffee machine and told me to analyze the problem from my husband's point of view. First, I was surprised. Later, on my way home, I did what he had suggested, and realized there was another side to the coinü™ô. The next day, I explicitly thanked that collegue for his honest opinion.</p> 
    <p>When my son was a pre-scholar he hated to make paintings and only did it when 'forced' in kindergarden, quickly and dispassionately. Seeing those pictures, I always said how good they were. One day he said to me: "Mom, you praise ALL my pictures. How will I know when I do have a really good one?" So why did I praise his pictures? Not because they were good, but because I love him and I wanted to encourage him.üñåÔ∏è</p>
    <p>My conclusions of those three unrelated experiences are: most 'good' feedback is a sign of sympathy or lack of interest or time to engage. 'Bad' feedback is valuable, you have to have the courage to really consider and evaluate it. - And there is this feedback, when the others just say 'WOW'. That happened to me when I learned to draw and - thanks to an excellent teacher - turned from dawing stick figures to awesome portraits in no time. I really hope that you and me will have this kind of feedback soon on our coding projectsüíª. In the meantime, I am thankful for all honest feedback.</p>`,
