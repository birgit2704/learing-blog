    <h4>How I got started</h4> 
    <p>It all started in June of 2022. My son came home from school all excited. "Mom, there's a memory trainer at our school today, we did some fun things and tonight he gives a presentation, I want to go!" So we went and the trainer caught me, too.</p><br>
    <p> While my friends were starting to complain about getting older and the occasional memory lapse, I could see that EVERYTHING was possible. So I thought to myself: Now, that I know that I can easily learn anything I want, what would excite me the most? The answer was right there: Coding. I have always wanted to learn to code, but then - life happened and I postponed and then I simply forgot...</p>
    <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4> 
    <p>I love coding, so it doesn't take much to stay committed. But of course I have those moments when everything seems too much, when I am frustrated or burnt out. Then I go back to the many projects that I have built up to now. Mostly, I think: Wow, I have built this? In just 12 months I have learned to create things like that? Magnificent! I also look at peers' projects and think: I could code that, too! Most of the time, this is enough to get me going again.</p>

    longText: ` <p>My husband still thinks that with all the time I spend coding, I will turn into some nerdy hacker. Like the ones on TV, who hack into systems, plant bugs, and sneek into server rooms to destroy - or save - the world.</p><br> <p>His view on computers and software is that both make life a lot more complicated and therefore have to be avoided at all cost. This is due to the insufficient training he -as physician and surgeon - has received in the hospitals he has been working. Generally, for him IT means filling out online forms, endlessly searching for files and calling Helpdesk.</p><br>
    <p>The other day, my son came into my "office". I proudly presented him the restaurant order app I was coding. He asked: "Mom, how much do they pay you when you have finished the app?" I answered, that I was still learning and, that I was me who was paying for the course to code. He just sighed, turned away and left.ðŸ¤‘</p><br>
    <p>I am waiting for the day when I sign an employment contract, then I'll invite both of them to something really fancy with the money I GET and I'll clarify that I will NEVER be able to hack the Pentagon.</p>

    longText: `<p>A little time ago, the telephone rang. It was a friend of a friend offering me a job ðŸ˜€- as office clerk for the local flower shop ðŸ˜­.</p><br>
    <p>I said, no thanks and that I was studying because I wanted to become a software developer. After I had hung up, I was very upset. Why did I say I WANTED to become a software developer? I was finishing my 9-module course and the only thing left for me to do was to finish the capstone project to get the certificate. What I should have said: "no thanks to your job offer, I AM a software developper and we should talk about your webpage, I have seen it can be improved. I have some ideas. When can we meet?" Why am I not confident like this?</p><br>
    <p>So I decided to get more confidence. I eat an apple every day (not to keep the doctor away, haha) and with every bite I say to myself: "I am a software developper" Do you know what? This simply and - admittedly stupid - routine has changed the way that I think of myself. I AM a software developper now. - Just not yet with a job.</p>`,

      "How I got stressed out while studying and how I dealt with it - or: the benefit of 'code-free' time.",
    longText: `<p>I love to read. Mostly books of self-improvement and one phrase that stuck was "Failing to plan is planning to fail". I wrote down a plan for the whole week, structuring each day, what I would learn, planning when I'll be finished with this module and then be able to start the next one, and on the weekends, I could do the Typescript course on the side and then next weekend, I would do a Git and Github refresher and with all that I'll finish the specialization in two months, but before I start to apply for a job, I'd need to at least take a look at SASS and Tailwind, which I could fit in if I expanded my studying time just by 15 minutes each day from now on.</p>
    <p>The next day, I enthusiastically worked off all the points on my plan and congratulated myself to this great decision to structure my time like that.</p>
    <p>The day after I struggled through the points.</p>
    <p>On the third day, I didn't quite get there and had to re-organize everything.</p>
    <p>The day after that I didn't feel like coding and started to clean my workplace. More thoroughly than ever.</p>
    <p>The next day I started the day with a good cry convinced that I would never reach any goal at all.</p><br>
    <p>I spent many weeks like that. Enthusiastic on Mondays and completely destroyed by Thursday at the latest.</p>
    <p>I turned to myself for help and came up with an idea. Do you want to know what did the trick for me? I didn't need to give up planning ahead, I just changed from "today I have to finish module 4" to "today I'll learn for two hours". I didn't feel the pressure any longer of having to reach a goal. Simply to do my best for the planned time was enough. This brought back the joy into my coding journey.</p>
    <p>And Sunday's are off. It is difficult to keep away from the keyboard for a whole day, but I do have a life, after all.</p>
